# HoloTap — TM470 Project and Personal Stripe‑Pay Alternative

A creator‑focused web application built with React and Vite, developed as part of the Open University TM470 project and continued as a personal initiative to explore lightweight, open, and transparent alternatives to closed payment ecosystems like Stripe‑Pay.

HoloTap combines modern frontend engineering with a modular, extensible architecture designed for experimentation, rapid iteration, and future integration with secure payment flows.
